<h1>Pocket Manifesto</h1>
<h2>(Installation, 2019)</h2>

<p>Pocket Manifesto is a dialogic space where participants explore issues relating to gender inequality. The entry point for the dialogue - that pockets in clothes made for girls and women often contain no pockets or inadequate pockets - is evidenced and explored by engaging with the Pocket Manifesto and the People's Pocket Improvement Programme.</p>
  
<h4>Pocket Manifesto – we believe that:</h4>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>Pockets are a basic human right that should be unfettered by fashion</li>
  <li>A bag is not a pocket</li>
  <li>Emancipation will happen one pocket at a time</li>
</ul>

<h4>The People’s Pocket Improvement Programme - we will: </h4>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>Embiggen the tiny pocket</li>
  <li>Fight the immorality of the fake pocket</li>
  <li>Provide pockets for the pocketlesse</li>
</ul>

<p>The space is established around a series of activities which include: a museum of pockets (which is itself housed inside some pockets), a pickpocket raffle, a pocket inspection, bunting featuring social media posts about pocket inequality, and the opportunity to participate in the retrofitting of pockets to pocket-deprived clothes.</p>
