<h1>Periodical</h1>
    <h2>(Installation, 2023)</h2>
<p>Periodical is an exploration of what constitutes meaningful when it comes to menstrual cycle data.</p>

<p>It's a personal reflection with no claim to universality, the point being that menstrual cycles are a phenomenon that are generally experienced alone, in private, unmentioned, and unobserved. Data is necessary for a better understanding of health and fertility and better diagnosis of serious medical conditions, but access to menstrual cycle data does tend to be limited to those who have one. It is an experience that is in some way common to nearly 4 billion people on Earth, but when those 4 billion people are, on the whole, women... well, therein lies problem.</p>

<p>The question that prompted this work was this: "How do digital technologies intertwine with the most intimate aspects of our lives?" Wisterlitz were comissioned by Control Shift to explore this question and create Periodical for the <a href="https://www.control-shift.network/programme.html">Feeling Machines Weekender</a>, Thursday 30 March - Sunday 2 April 2023.</p> 

<p>Periodical is in part a collection of journal entries, made by Liz and Becky over the course of the 28 days of February 2023. It is an analogue collection, displayed as a circular mobile but arranged in no particular order. <a href="https://youtu.be/IobS0oCgb2Y">See it here.</a> Displayed alongside other objects and activities, Periodical provides a place for people to come and explore, share, be curious about about menstrual cycle data.</p> 

<p>Periodical also exists in digital form <a href="https://www.instagram.com/periodical.2023/" here </a>, as a collection of 28 prompts that can be used to inspire thoughts and reflections on health, wellbeing and the menstrual cycle.</p>
