<h1>Risen</h1>
<h2>(Curation & Installation, 2024)</h2>
<p>Risen is a dialogic space containing a collection of works that explore bread. Why bread? Because bread is everyday and ordinary, but also eternal, full of symbolism, and intertwined with innovation, revolt and revolution. It is illustrative of our modern food system, what, how and even why we eat. Bread is food and food is bread.</p>
