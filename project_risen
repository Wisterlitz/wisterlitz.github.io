<h1>Risen</h1>
<h2>(Curation & Installation, 2024)</h2>
<p>Risen is a dialogic space containing a collection of works that explore bread.</p>

<p>Why bread? Because bread is everyday and ordinary, but also eternal, symbolic, and intertwined with human development, innovation, and revolution. Bread is food and food is bread, and it works as an illustration of our modern food system: the what, how and even why we eat.</p>
